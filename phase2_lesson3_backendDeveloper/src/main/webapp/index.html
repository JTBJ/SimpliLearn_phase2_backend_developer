	<h1>Welcome Page</h1>
	<br />

	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>Initialize the Session</b></legend>
		<a href="InitHibernateServlet">Initialize Hibernate session</a> <br />
		<p>This link opens and closes the Hibernate session. If you run
			this program , you will receive the print out to the browser as 
			well as the console to reference this connection.</p>
	</fieldset>
	
	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>List Content in a Table</b></legend>
		<a href="ListContentServlet">List Students</a> <br />
		<p>Instead of creating an EProducts table, I completed this task using a student 
		table. Being the main focus of this assignment is the read opertion in the CRUD.
		sense, I simply read from the student table I created for another project.</p>
	</fieldset>
	
	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>Using Hibernate with Annotations</b></legend>
		<a href="PersistentClassServlet">Hibernate with Annotations</a> <br />
		<p>Like in the previous link, I have included code that will create a new table each
		time this link is clicked and display the data to the browser and / or console.</p>
	</fieldset>
	
	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>Using Log4j</b></legend>
		<p>There is no link with Log4j as it is a configuration added for the entire project.
		As always, I created projects for all assignments as one big project, with links redirecting
		you to each objective of every assignment. The dependency for log4j was added to my pom.xml 
		file and the log4j.properties file was added to the class path. There for, upon each run of 
		any aspect of the entire application, you will see detailed logging information logged to the 
		console. There is no link for log4j.
		</p>
	</fieldset>
	
	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>Collection Mapping in Hibernate</b></legend>
		<a href="ProductDetailsServlet">Collection Mapping</a> <br />
		<p>Because there are several classes, hbm mapping files, controller and view, I decided to use
		the specific names provided within the example. The details of this aspect of the project closely
		follows the program example provided to help.
		</p>
	</fieldset>
	
	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>Hibernate Lazy Collection</b></legend>
		<p>Being that the Lazy-loading of the collection requirements for this assignment only require the
		programmer to set the "lazy" attribute to true for collection mapping, I went ahead and set this attribute
		in place during the creating of the previous link's program operations. Therefore, there is no link for 
		lazy collection loading.
		</p>
	</fieldset>
	
	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>Component Mapping in Hibernate</b></legend>
		<a href="ComponentMapping_ProductDetailsServlet">Component Mapping</a> <br />
		<p>Here is another project that follows the example provided with the assignment.
		</p>
	</fieldset>
	
	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>Integration of Hibernate with Spring</b></legend>
		<p>I did not create the Maven, Spring, Hibernate aspect within this project, as I wasn't sure how
		to create a muti-module implementation within this current project. Most of all, I didn't want to
		corrupt any of the current program I have worked hard to complete. The required final Practice project
		is included within this program and its link follows this section. I will look into creating this aspect
		of the program within another project in the future for self learning.
		</p>
	</fieldset>
	
	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>Final: Add New Product to the Database</b></legend>
		<a href="addProduct.jsp">Add New Product</a> <br />
		<p>In this project, I use code from an existing class that I created to build a data base. I will used 
		this code as the template to add to the pre-created database.
		</p>
