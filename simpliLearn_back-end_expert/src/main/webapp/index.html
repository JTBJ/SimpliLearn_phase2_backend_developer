		<h3>The projects in this section correspond to the practice
			projects and final project submission for section "Developing Dynamic
			Web Pages Using Servlets".
			<br/><br/>
			For section 1.6 of the practice projects, 
			I have used Servlets and JSP files, which are implicitly converted to
			servlets once the program is compiled, to represent the servlet
			implementations for this assignment. 
			<br/><br/>
			I was kind of moving fast when I
			created the servlet to extend the servlet interface and the servlet
			to implement the generic servlet class as the order in which they
			appear in my application are reversed. I also used a selection list
			to allow the user to select a country instead of accepting a name
			from the text field to pass information to the servlet, for the
			generic servlet project.
			<br/><br/>
			Within section 1.10 you will find that I
			included the project for section 1.12. Here I used a filter and a
			servlet-context to display information to the console. I did not
			include a link that doesn't use these techniques explicitly for this
			project, as I have other links for other aspects of the projects that cover the
			effect of what is required here. 
			<br/><br/>
			In section 1.20, only Session
			tracking is used to track the session, but here I simply redirected
			the web page to the cookie page, indicating the session is being
			tracked. 
			<br/><br/>
			For the last two sections, 1.22 and 1.23, I have merged the
			objectives of both. The user logout functionality as well as the
			username and password and form validation, for text fields are
			included across 4 files, I think. 
			<br/><br/>
			The last statement I want to make
			about this project submission is that I heavily utilized the use of
			JSP files within my program.</h3>
